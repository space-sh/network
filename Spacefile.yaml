portfree:
    _info:
        title: Check if a network port is free
        desc: |
            Uses sockstat or netstat to figure out if any process is listening to the port.
            Does not differ on interfaces, so a port is considered not free if a process
            is listening on it on all or just a specific interface.
    _env:
        - port:
            title: Port number to check if it is free or not
        - RUN: NETWORK_PORT_FREE -- "${port}"

localip:

        title: Get a local IP, optionally of a specified adapter
        desc: |
            Uses `ifconfig` to get all adapters, sorts on inet and discards the gateways (all IPs ending with .1),
            returning the largest IP.
    _env:
        - adapter:
            title: Adapters as seen in ifconfig (optional)
        - RUN: NETWORK_LOCAL_IP -- "${adapter}"
